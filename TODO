- Remove "caption" custom field
- Cleanup page hierarchy (and therefore top nav menu)
- Hide title on certain page, options:
  - Meta attribute of "title = false" and theme re-acts
- Footer Sitemap
- Promotion call out on all pages
- Remove "news" category
- Add Shop, Donate, Education, Event categories
- Use jQuery to class up feature items with left/right classes so that CSS can apply rules to make image appear on either left or right

Blog sections are category pages, breadcrumbs should work fine, so should search.  However menu will not highlight.  Will need to use javascript to highlight menu based on breadcrumb path?  Then decordate CSS class to li item.

Hmm... not going to work as it also has other static pages in the section (see education)

IMPORTANT!! Use "news" in inverted commas as category for query posts plugin and see if it works!
