- Update permalinks and .htacess file
- Install all required plugins
  - Add redirect custom field for "redirect by custom field" plugin
- Remove the custom menus and instead rely upon wp_page_menu???
- Re-upload the twentyten theme completely from WP 3.1 archive (it appears to have been modified and functions are missing)
